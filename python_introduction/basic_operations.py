# Task One: Basic Arithmetic Exercise

# Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers

# Assign specific values to two variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
addition = number1 + number2

subtraction =  number1 - number2

multiplication = number1 * number2

# Calculation Results
print(f"Addition of {number2} and {number2} is {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number2} and {number2} is {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number2} and {number2} is {multiplication}")
